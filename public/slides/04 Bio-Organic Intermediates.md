# Chemicals used in the _Bio-Organic Intermediates_ sector

Bio-Organic Intermediates have evolved into a high-complexity but non-specialized, import-dominated vertical, with limited integration into Romania’s productive core.

Export values for this vertical grew steadily from ~35 million USD (1965–1969) to a peak of 928 million USD (2015–2019). Although they fell to 495 million USD in 2020–2024, the vertical maintained very high complexity (PCI ~62–63). However, RCA declined from 4.9 (1970–1974) to below 1 after 2010, indicating a loss of trade specialization despite increasing product sophistication.

Since 2000, imports have grown rapidly, exceeding 3.8 billion USD (2020–2024). This indicates that Romania is integrated into global bio-organic value chains mainly as a consumer or processor of intermediates, with limited domestic anchoring or retention of value.
