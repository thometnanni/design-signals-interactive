# Chemicals used in the _Inorganic Processing Inputs_ sector

Romania had a long-standing export specialization in *inorganic inputs*, exceeding the RCA competitiveness threshold until the *late 2000s*. The sharp decline in both export value and RCA after 2010 indicates disintegration from regional processing chains and marginalization of basic input exports. The vertical has shifted from competitive exporter to a residual contributor to the trade structure.

<!-- Exports of inorganic processing inputs, oxides, carbonates, acids, and similar, grew from ~46 million USD in 1960–64 to peaks of over 1 billion USD in 2005–2009, before declining to ~220 million USD in 2020–24. Imports followed a more stable upward trend, exceeding 1.3 billion USD annually in the 2010s. Export share remained low (peaking around 0.00013) and the average PCI hovered around 50–55, reflecting moderate product complexity. Romania recorded a high Norm RCA in early periods (above 16), but this fell to ~2.1 by 2020–2024. -->

This vertical includes bulk inputs used in metallurgy, glass, ceramics, and other transformation industries. Its export potential was high during socialist industrialization and remained relevant in the early 2000s through connections to regional production chains. However, both PCI and RCA trends show erosion of structural competitiveness and gradual replacement of exports with imports in the most recent period.
