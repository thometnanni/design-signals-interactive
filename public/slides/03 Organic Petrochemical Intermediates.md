# Chemicals used in the _Organic Petrochemical Intermediates_ sector

Romania lost its competitive position in *petrochemical intermediates* after 2005. Despite a still moderately complex export portfolio, falling RCA and contracting export value confirm structural disconnection from value-added chains. The vertical has shifted from strategic exporter to dependent importer, with legacy capacities eroding.

<!-- This vertical showed strong export activity during the socialist period, rising from "46 million USD in 1960–64" to 930 million USD in 1985–89, with a peak in the early 2000s (~1.6 billion USD in 2005–09). Since then, exports have steadily declined to ~400 million USD in 2020–24. Imports followed a similar but steeper trajectory, reaching 2.9 billion USD in 2010–14. PCI values steadily increased from ~57 to 66, confirming a complexification of the product base. Romania’s Norm RCA exceeded 10 until 2004, but declined to 1.6 in the 2020s. -->

These intermediates, alcohols, acids, phenols, ethers, etc., were historically core to Romania’s petrochemical industry, particularly under centralized industrial planning. They were used in the production of plastics, resins, solvents, and fine chemicals. The early 2000s spike reflects temporary integration into regional refinery and chemical processing chains, but this was not sustained.
