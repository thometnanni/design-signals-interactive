# Chemicals used in the _Cosmetics and Personal Care_ sector

Romania developed a moderate export specialization in cosmetics and cleaning products during the 2005–2019 period, reflected in mid-level complexity and consistent RCA above 5. The post-2020 contraction suggests either domestic restructuring or reduced foreign production embedded in Romania. Despite this, the vertical remains structurally import-dependent and below global competitiveness thresholds.

<!-- Romania's exports in cosmetics and personal care rose significantly from negligible levels in the early decades to a peak of over 2.6 billion USD in 2015–2019, followed by a sharp decline to 1.2 billion USD in 2020–2024. Imports consistently outpaced exports, with annual real import values exceeding 5 billion USD post-2010. Export share remained modest (~0.01%), and the PCI hovered around 48–54, indicating moderately complex products. Norm RCA ranged from 5.6 to 7.0 in the recent three decades. -->

These values reflect strong demand and a sustained period of partial specialization between 2005 and 2019, driven by soaps, cleaning products, and low- to mid-range perfumery. However, the 2020–2024 period shows both a sharp contraction in export value and a flattening of RCA, indicating weakening integration into global trade for this vertical. Imports remain structurally high, indicating consumption-led exposure to global supply chains.
