# Chemicals used in the _Pharmaceuticals_ sector

Romania is not competitively specialized in pharmaceuticals. Despite rising complexity and temporary export surges, the sector operates under FDI-led or foreign-controlled production without a strong RCA base. Structural dependence is confirmed by persistent import surpluses and weak RCA.

Nonetheless, Romania developed a significant pharmaceutical manufacturing sector in the post-socialist period, including packaging, generics, and contract production. However, the RCA values and trade balance show the country remains a dependent consumer in global pharma chains. High PCI reflects the complexity of goods traded but not domestic innovation or specialization.

Pharmaceutical exports grew exponentially, from ~0.7 million USD in 1960–64 to a peak of 5.2 billion USD in 2010–14, before contracting to ~1.9 billion USD in 2020–24. Imports outpaced exports by a wide margin, especially after 2000, reaching 13.5 billion USD in the 2010s. PCI values rose from ~57 to 71.8, reflecting consistent product sophistication. Norm RCA remained well below 10, never exceeding ~3.8.
