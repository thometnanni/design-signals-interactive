# Chemicals used in the _Dyes and Pigments_ sector

Dyes and pigments are a technically sophisticated input class with strong local demand but low export specialization. Romania’s role remains that of importer and downstream transformer, rather than global supplier. The sector exhibits no signs of competitive advantage and remains a secondary component of broader chemical integration.

<!-- Exports of dyes and pigments rose gradually through the decades, reaching a maximum of 256 million USD in 2015–2019, before declining to ~142 million USD in 2020–2024. Imports have always been significantly higher, reaching up to 900 million USD in some periods, indicating consistent trade deficits. The PCI remained stable and relatively high (~61–63), reflecting the synthetic and specialized nature of these compounds. Norm RCA increased slightly over time but remained in the 2–4 range, well below competitiveness thresholds. -->

The export structure includes synthetic organic coloring matter, prepared pigments, and industrial dyes, likely linked to Romania’s textiles, leather, and plastics sectors. Despite relatively high PCI, export shares have remained minimal and Romania has not succeeded in turning this into an export-oriented specialization. Import reliance persists, especially on complex intermediates.
