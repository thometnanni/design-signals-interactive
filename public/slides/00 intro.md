# Introduction

Romaniaâ€™s chemical sectors shifted from socialist-era export strength to post-2000 import dependence and fragmented competitiveness.  

*Automotive Chemicals*, *Rubber*, and *Plastics and Packaging* became export pillars, while *Fertilizers*, *Petrochemical Intermediates*, and *Commodity Thermoplastics* lost specialization. *Bio-Organics*, *Pharmaceuticals*, and *Bio-Pharma* remain import-driven, while *Explosives*, *Dyes*, or *Media Chemicals* show selective adaptation or obsolescence.  

The graph maps sectors by *product complexity* and *trade balance*. Each point contains a sub-graph tracing its trajectory across decades, showing whether Romania was mainly exporter or importer and how complexity changed.
