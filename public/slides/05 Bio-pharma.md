# Chemicals used in the _Bio-pharma_ sector

Bio-pharma evolved from a niche socialist capability to a structurally import-dependent sector. Romania is not competitively integrated in bio-pharma global value chains and primarily functions as a consumption and packaging node.

Exports of vitamins, glycosides, and alkaloids grew slowly from the 1960s, reaching ~29 million USD by the late 1980s, but never exceeded a minor share of Romania’s exports. Between 2000–2024, bio-pharma exports increased to 145 million USD (2010–2014) and then stagnated, while imports reached nearly 2.5 billion USD annually after 2010.

Despite gradual increases in Norm PCI (from ~52 to ~68), Norm RCA dropped below 1 after 2010, far below the competitiveness threshold of 10. This indicates a complete loss of export specialization in this vertical, despite rising product complexity.
