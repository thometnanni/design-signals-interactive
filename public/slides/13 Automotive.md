# Chemicals used in the _Automotive_ sector

Automotive chemicals constitute a core vertical in Romania’s industrial model, combining high complexity, strong export performance, and persistent comparative advantage.

<!-- Between 2000 and 2019, this vertical underwent a significant expansion. Export values rose from 1.2 billion USD (2000–2004) to over 9.4 billion USD (2015–2019). The average PCI remained consistently high (~62–64), and RCA increased from 11.2 (2000–2004) to 17.7 (2020–2024), indicating strong and sustained international competitiveness. -->

These dynamics reflect the strategic consolidation of automotive chemical inputs, such as tires, engineered plastics, conveyor belts, and anti-knock agents, as part of Romania’s export platform. This was driven by multinational investment and industrial relocation, primarily to regions like Timiș, Argeș, and Cluj. Although export value decreased to 3.9 billion USD in 2020–2024, complexity and specialization remained intact.
