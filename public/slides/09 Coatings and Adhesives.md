# Chemicals used in the _Coatings and Adhesives_ sector

Coatings and Adhesives form a medium-complexity vertical with moderate and stable exports, but Romania does not surpass the competitiveness threshold. The sector plays a limited manufacturing or finishing role, with low domestic value capture.

Romania maintained steady export growth of adhesives, varnishes, resins, and specialty inks from ~30 million USD in the 1980s to a peak of ~657 million USD in 2015–2019. Exports declined slightly to 328 million USD in 2020–2024, while imports remained consistently above 1 billion USD.

Norm PCI remained high throughout (around 67–71), but Norm RCA stayed between 3.9–5.3, below the competitiveness threshold. Although these values indicate some degree of specialization, they do not reflect sustained comparative advantage.
